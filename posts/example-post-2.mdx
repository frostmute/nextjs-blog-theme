Concept: https://dg-docs.ole.dev/advanced/hosting-alternatives/ 

1. Clone repository: https://github.com/oleeskild/digitalgarden 

(USE THIS TEMPLATE > CREATE A NEW REPOSITORY) NAME THE REPOSITORY "</GITHUBNAME/>.github.io"

1. Configure build.yml: https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden/discussions/389 

Set repository --> Settings --> Pages --> Source (Deploy from a branch): gh-pages

1. View Actions and see if they are successful!

## Build,yml


name: GH Pages

    on:
      push:
        branches: [ "main" ]
      pull_request:
        branches: [ "main" ]

    jobs:
      build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [20.x]
        # See supported Node.js release schedule at https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: 'npm'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run build --if-present

      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          publish_dir: ./dist
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}


permissions:

contents: read

pages: write

id-token: write

concurrency:

group: "pages"

cancel-in-progress: false

concurrency:

group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR TOKEN -> ACTION SECRET

You will need to add a GH_TOKEN secret to your repo, which should be a github API token having access to your repo. (You can reuse the one you have in your plugin settings)

You will also need to name your repository in github, `<username>.github.io`. 

For example: `username.github.io`. 

This is because otherwise the URL will be `<username>.github.io/<repositoryname>`. 

This will cause errors when the site tries to get CSS and Javascript from URLs like `<username>.github.io/styles/style.css`, because they are actually located in `<username>.github.io/<repositoryname>/styles/style.css`.
